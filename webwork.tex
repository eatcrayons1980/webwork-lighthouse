The chilled air burst into a brief gust as she neared the top of the hill.
The wind snuck under the collar of her jacket, making her unconsciously
pull it tighter around her neck. Up ahead, the data camp was already bustling with activity. It was a slow,
steady, productive type of busy. It was the type of busy brought about by
stiff limbs, a barely lit, pre-dawn sky, and recently awoken minds.

She stopped for a moment, watching these strangers working. Most groups were unpacking
large bags of equipment. Some were working on their screens. It was too early
to setup the power arrays, but there were enough batteries being wired up on this hilltop
to power a small camp for a week.

Most of this work was performed in silence. The majority of the voices she
was hearing could be traced to the food shed. This was the only permanent
building on the hilltop, and even this was simple wood construction, no
paint, and a roof which would obviously be leaking in several places if not
for the unusually clear day.

Compared to the rest of the area, the food shed had attracted a lively group.
The owner was serving coffee and seemed to have plenty of food on the grill.
People were gathered, discussing the mild events of a quiet life.

She became aware of the fact that she was avoiding entering the camp proper.
She set about deciding where to set up. After all, nothing would postpone the
broadcast. It was a busy morning, but she did not see anyone she recognized, but
this didn't really surprise her. Almost everyone she knew had stayed at the
farm.

Out of habit, she headed to her usual spot. It was off to the side of the camp
near a lone fir tree that flagged the nearby treeline. It was a little lower than
most people would set up, but she hadn't missed a broadcast yet. As she made her
way over, she noticed a few of the usuals camped nearby. She was shy, and they
were shy; which was probably the reason she didn't know anyone on the hill,
despite the number of trips she had made.

The pack she carried was heavy, there was no other way to put it, and she was
happy to lower it off her back. She looked at her watch, realizing she didn't
have much time to waste. Her setup ritual always started by unpacking everything.
After unzipping the pack and unfastening the waterproof seal, she began removing
the farm's equipment. At first, most of what she removed were simply cables,
bound with velcro straps or fastened with string. Each was labelled with tape,
declaring the owner of that specific cable. Under the cables lay the collected
electronics of the farm. Most were wrapped in cloth and bound. Others were
protected further still with foam or waterproof bags. For now, she left them
in a small pile on the ground, still protected in their individual nests.

Next to be removed was the antenna. There was nothing special about this device.
The grey box was about as long as her forarm, but squared and heavy. She didn't
know the story behind the farms' antenna, but it was obviously custom made.
It was hardly impressive, and the antenna her family had when she was a child
made this one seem shabby, but it managed to serve the needs of the farm.
Despite her distaste for it, she handled it carefully, setting in gently on the
grass next to the other equipment.

The pack was now empty except for one item. A large battery pack, easily thirty
pounds on its own, filled most of the bottom area of the backpack. This she left
in the pack, but unzipped it fully to expose the numerous power connections.

It was probably selfish, but when she hiked to data camp alone, she always 
connected her equipment first. She removed the worn Tile from her jacket.
It had been given to her by her mother, who had received it, in turn, from
her father. It had been repaired many times, but seemed to handle each
fix well. Her Tile was the only one in the farm and knew the others thought
her undeserving of such a device. She removed a small cable from her jacket
and connected the Tile to the antenna.

She had instructions for connecting everything else, stored away in the front pouch of the
pack, but she felt certain she could do it without them. She sat with the backpack
in front of her, between her outstretched legs, and started unwrapping the
smaller pieces of equipment. Many of the devices connected directly to the
battery pack, while others hooked through the connections on other things.
The web of components started taking a somewhat familiar shape, in a way she
couldn't explain but which told her she wouldn't need to reference the instructions.

There was now a problem. Her mind told her not to worry, but her gut knew
she was missing a cable. Karin's Hand Page still lay in the pile of unconnected
equipment, and a quick glance at the pile of cables told her the one she needed
was not included in the set. She picked up the pace connecting the last devices.
Losing Karin's cable would be bad and would not help Tyler win any points with
her mates on the farm. As she made connections between the last couple devices,
her suspicions were confirmed. Feeling around in the bottom of the pack turned
up nothing. It's doubtful anything fell out of the backpack, what with it being
waterproof sealed and zipped up tight. But even if the wire turned up later,
back at the farm, Karin will have missed her broadcast, and Tyler will be
blamed.

Frustrated with herself, she made a helpless glance around the area in which
she was seated. To no surprise, nothing was lying unconnected around her. Well,
the antenna was still not connected. She smiled as she hooked up the most
important component, as she thought about how much worse the situation would
have been, had she forgotten to hook up the antenna as she hunted for one
cable. And anyway, Karin and her were on good terms. Certainly, she could make
it seven days without a broadcast. But still, this was a sloppy move.

As she sat with her thoughts, the sun rose behind her. She noticed the ambient
change and glanced back at the sliver of yellow in the distance. Two weeks ago
when she was here, the sun hadn't come up until the broadcast had started. Her
watch told her she had another three minutes today.

Sometimes the broadcasts were late. Less often, they were early. One of her
first weeks on the farm, an early broadcast was responsible for a ninety percent data loss.
Joseph was blamed for the loss, and had few friends for the following six days.
The next broadcast confirmed his story, but even with his name cleared,
he had yet to travel back to the data camp for broadcast.

The beeps from the devices in front of her signalled that today's broadcast
was more or less on time. The indicator on the battery pack showed as full.
Even Karin's Hand Page turned on, reminding Tyler of her screw up. She reached
over and shut it off. There was no sense running down the battery, as well.
A quick look over the other equipment verified that everything was ready
for the broadcast.



Part 2

Tyler rounded the bend that signified she was three miles from the farm. The
broadcast felt like a wash. On one hand, it had been smooth: her draw
had been high, the manifest had completed with no errors, and power draw had
been rather low. On the other hand, she was thinking the whole way home about
how to apologize to Karin.

The last three miles was always the longest. On foot, a trip to data camp took
four and a half hours. With a good broadcast draw you could do the whole thing
in five. Many of the other travellers to data camp came on horseback. Some even
drove. On Tyler's farm, though, the horses were usually put to work. They didn't
have any motorized vehicles, at least, of which she was aware. They had always
walked. She had volunteered for the trips soon after her arrival at the farm, and
after a few months of shadowing the process, they gave her the responsibility
of making the trip solo.

Despite the season, it had warmed up quickly. She had removed her jacket before
leaving data camp. The skin of her arms and face was still chilled, but she could
tell her shirt was damp with sweat under the straps of the backpack.

She passed by the farms' nearest neighbor, an old recluse who went by Peters.
His home barely qualified as a shack, but the old metal roof seemed to miraculously
support an impressive power array. The panels, covered in dust, must have been
working, considering the volume of the music being played in the house. His windows
were curtained with various cloth materials but Tyler always felt like she was
being watched when she was passing the house.

Another half hour and she was passing through the open gate and walking up the road
to the farmhouse.

The main house was an ancient house, with six official bedrooms,
but it currently slept around thirty people. Additionally, scattered around the rest of the
property were a handful of other buildings which housed an additional forty or so.

Tyler made her way up to the house. Several of her mates waved at her as they
milled around tending to the business of the farm, but there was no grand celebration
for her safe return.

On broadcast day, all the members of the farm ate lunch together. Even if you
had nothing on the manifest, you were required to sign in. The landlords would
assist in settling disputes. Issues pertaining to the farm were discussed. Weekly
assignments were given out. At the end of this event, the devices could be collected.

Since the trip had gone smoothly, there was still time before the meal was prepared.
Tyler had decided to apologize to Karin before lunch. Inside the house, she made her
way downstairs to the basement. Bryce was in the basement, with several lights on
around him. He was inspecting some data on a page on the wall.
