\chapter{One}
The chilled air burst into a brief gust as she neared the top of
the hill. The wind crept under the collar of her jacket, making
her unconsciously pull it tighter around her neck. Up ahead, the
data camp was already bustling with activity. It was a slow,
steady, productive type of busy. It was the type of busy brought
about by stiff limbs, a barely lit, pre-dawn sky, and recently
awoken minds.

She stopped for a moment, watching these strangers working. Most
groups were unpacking large bags of equipment. Some were working
on their screens. It was too early to setup the power arrays,
but there were enough batteries being wired up on this hilltop
to power a small camp for a week.

Most of this work was performed in silence. The majority of the
voices she was hearing could be traced to the food shed. This
was the only permanent building on the hilltop, and even this
was simple wood construction, no paint, and a roof which would
obviously be leaking in several places if not for the unusually
clear day.

Compared to the rest of the area, the food shed had attracted a
lively group. The owner was serving coffee and seemed to have
plenty of food on the grill. People were gathered, discussing
the mild events of a quiet life.

She became aware of the fact that she was avoiding entering the
camp proper. She set about deciding where to set up. After all,
nothing would postpone the broadcast. It was a busy morning, but
she did not see anyone she recognized, but this didn't really
surprise her. Almost everyone she knew had stayed at the farm.

Out of habit, she headed to her usual spot. It was off to the
side of the camp near a lone fir tree that flagged the nearby
tree line. It was a little lower than most people would set up,
but she hadn't missed a broadcast yet. As she made her way over,
she noticed a few of the usuals camped nearby. She was shy, and
they were shy; which was probably the reason she didn't know
anyone on the hill, despite the number of trips she had made.

The pack she carried was heavy, there was no other way to put
it, and she was happy to lower it off her back. She looked at
her watch, realizing she didn't have much time to waste. Her
setup ritual always started by unpacking everything. After
unzipping the pack and unfastening the waterproof seal, she
began removing the farm's equipment. At first, most of what she
removed were simply cables, bound with Velcro straps or fastened
with string. Each was labeled with tape, declaring the owner of
that specific cable. Under the cables lay the collected
electronics of the farm. Most were wrapped in cloth and bound.
Others were protected further still with foam or waterproof
bags. For now, she left them in a small pile on the ground,
still protected in their individual nests.

Next to be removed was the antenna. There was nothing special
about this device. The gray box was about as long as her forearm,
but squared and heavy. She didn't know the story behind the
farms' antenna, but it was obviously custom made. It was hardly
impressive, and the antenna her family had when she was a child
made this one seem shabby, but it managed to serve the needs of
the farm. Despite her distaste for it, she handled it carefully,
setting in gently on the grass next to the other equipment.

The pack was now empty except for one item. A large battery
pack, easily thirty pounds on its own, filled most of the bottom
area of the backpack. This she left in the pack, but unzipped it
fully to expose the numerous power connections.

It was probably selfish, but when she hiked to data camp alone,
she always connected her equipment first. She removed the worn
Tile from her jacket. It had been given to her by her mother,
who had received it, in turn, from her father. It had been
repaired many times, but seemed to handle each fix well. Her
Tile was the only one in the farm and knew the others thought
her undeserving of such a device. She removed a small cable from
her jacket and connected the Tile to the antenna.

She had instructions for connecting everything else, stored away
in the front pouch of the pack, but she felt certain she could
do it without them. She sat with the backpack in front of her,
between her outstretched legs, and started unwrapping the
smaller pieces of equipment. Many of the devices connected
directly to the battery pack, while others hooked through the
connections on other things. The web of components started
taking a somewhat familiar shape, in a way she couldn't explain
but which told her she wouldn't need to reference the
instructions.

There was now a problem. Her mind told her not to worry, but her
gut knew she was missing a cable. Karin's Hand Page still lay in
the pile of unconnected equipment, and a quick glance at the
pile of cables told her the one she needed was not included in
the set. She picked up the pace connecting the last devices.
Losing Karin's cable would be bad and would not help Tyler win
any points with her mates on the farm. As she made connections
between the last couple devices, her suspicions were confirmed.
Feeling around in the bottom of the pack turned up nothing. It's
doubtful anything fell out of the backpack, what with it being
waterproof sealed and zipped up tight. But even if the wire
turned up later, back at the farm, Karin will have missed her
broadcast, and Tyler will be blamed.

Frustrated with herself, she made a helpless glance around the
area in which she was seated. To no surprise, nothing was lying
unconnected around her. Well, the antenna was still not
connected. She smiled as she hooked up the most important
component, as she thought about how much worse the situation
would have been, had she forgotten to hook up the antenna as she
hunted for one cable. And anyway, Karin and her were on good
terms. Certainly, she could make it seven days without a
broadcast. But still, this was a sloppy move.

As she sat with her thoughts, the sun rose behind her. She
noticed the ambient change and glanced back at the sliver of
yellow in the distance. Two weeks ago when she was here, the sun
hadn't come up until the broadcast had started. Her watch told
her she had another three minutes today.

Sometimes the broadcasts were late. Less often, they were early.
One of her first weeks on the farm, an early broadcast was
responsible for a ninety percent data loss. Joseph was blamed
for the loss, and had few friends for the following six days.
The next broadcast confirmed his story, but even with his name
cleared, he had yet to travel back to the data camp for
broadcast.

The beeps from the devices in front of her signaled that
today's broadcast was more or less on time. The indicator on the
battery pack showed as full. Even Karin's Hand Page turned on,
reminding Tyler of her screw up. She reached over and shut it
off. There was no sense running down the battery, as well. A
quick look over the other equipment verified that everything was
ready for the broadcast.

\chapter{Two}
Tyler rounded the bend that signified she was three miles from
the farm. The broadcast had felt like a wash. On one hand, it
had been smooth: her draw had been high, the manifest had
completed with no errors, and power draw had been rather low. On
the other hand, she was thinking the whole way home about how to
apologize to Karin.

The last three miles was always the longest. On foot, a trip to
data camp took four and a half hours. With a good broadcast draw
you could do the whole thing in five. Many of the other
travelers to data camp came on horseback. Some even drove. On
Tyler's farm, though, the horses were usually put to work. They
didn't have any motorized vehicles, at least, of which she was
aware. They had always walked. She had volunteered for the trips
soon after her arrival at the farm, and after a few months of
shadowing the process, they gave her the responsibility of
making the trip solo.

Despite the season, it had warmed up quickly. She had removed
her jacket before leaving data camp. The skin of her arms and
face was still chilled, but she could tell her shirt was damp
with sweat under the straps of the backpack.

She passed by the farms' nearest neighbor, an old recluse who
went by Peters. His home barely qualified as a shack, but the
old metal roof seemed to miraculously support an impressive
power array. The panels, covered in dust, must have been
working, considering the volume of the music being played in the
house. His windows were curtained with various cloth materials
but Tyler always felt like she was being watched when she was
passing the house.

Another half hour and she was passing through the open gate and
walking up the road to the farmhouse.

The main house was an ancient house, with six official bedrooms,
but it currently slept around thirty people. Additionally,
scattered around the rest of the property were a handful of
other buildings which housed an additional forty or so.

Tyler made her way up to the house. Several of her mates waved
at her as they milled around tending to the business of the
farm, but there was no grand celebration for her safe return.

On broadcast day, all the members of the farm ate lunch
together. Even if you had nothing on the manifest, you were
required to sign in. The landlords would assist in settling
disputes. Issues pertaining to the farm were discussed. Weekly
assignments were given out. At the end of this event, the
devices could be collected.

Since the trip had gone smoothly, there was still time before
the meal was prepared. Tyler had decided to apologize to Karin
before lunch. Inside the house, she made her way downstairs to
the basement. Bryce was in the basement, with several lights on
around him. He was inspecting some data using a page on the
wall. Bryce maintained the data on the farm, and it kept him
very busy. In addition to caring for the equipment, he assisted
with special tasks and device repairs. He was certainly no
wizard with tools, but he cared about details and always took
his time. Also, he was the best person for the job right now.

"You forgot Karin's cable, today," he said as she entered. His
eyes remained focused on his work.

"Yeah...," was the best she could come up with as she crossed
the room and unloaded her pack onto a bench next to the far
wall. The missing cable sat in the center of the nearby table.
"Do you know where she is?"

"Haven't seen her. But she's probably out back. I think she has
the plane working." Bryce gave her a sly smile. Tyler raised an
eyebrow in return. The plane was working? That would be worth
seeing, even if it came along with delivery of some bad news.

\chapter{Three}
It turned out that the plane was not working. You could say the
plane was RUNNING... sort of. You could say the plane was
MOVING. You could NOT, however, say the plane was working. But
still, there it sat in the yard, propeller spinning away with a
quiet hum. A small group of the farms inhabitants were looking
at the plane awkwardly. They were looking at the plane awkwardly
to avoid looking at Karin, who was looking at Tyler.

"So, what you're saying," Karin said patronizingly, "is that traveling to Broadcast isn't
something you're able to take care of on your own?" She continued, obviously
not expecting an answer, "I understand it's a lot of stress. We can find
someone else who wants to take it seriously."

Karin was a little
angrier than Tyler had expected. Their present situation had
been building in the two minutes since Tyler had given her
the bad news. She would have appreciated someone coming 
to her defense, but that wasn't likely. Everyone knew the frustration
of missing Broadcast, including Tyler.

"Look, Karin, I'm sorry. I can't fix this. I can only tell you I'm sorry.
You can be mad at me if you want."

The plea had no affect.

"You don't get it!" Karin finally shouted. "The plan for the last piece of the plane was on my
manifest. What the hell am I supposed to do for the next week? I have
nothing to work on! They never should have let you go alone."

With this final exasperated observation, the young woman turned in
her boots. One quick gesture on her control board silenced the motor
powering the planes' rotor. The small crowd nearby made a performance
of avoiding the enraged girl by nearly scattering as she approached.
Karin lifted the plane despite its seven foot wingspan and headed to
the workshop next to the barn.


\chapter{Four}
By lunchtime, the tension lifted somewhat. The surprisingly beautiful
weather meant that this weeks' Broadcast lunch was held outdoors.
Long wooden tables, set just off the farmhouses' back porch, served
these events well. Off to one side of the eating area, the landlords 
sat at their own, smaller table. The community
sign-in book was open on their table, and the landlords greeted, and
made smalltalk with, the members of the farm as they approached the
table to sign in. Although Broadcast Lunch was taken seriously, there
seemed to be an unspoken agreement amongst the farmers to keep
the mood light.

Tyler was sitting with her friend, Triss. Primarily a field hand, his appearance
hardly fit the job description. He was tall, with miniature, wiry, muscles.
His face was long, narrow, and with high cheekbones. His hair was jet black,
thick, and long enough to cover most of his ears and neck. The poor guy was
allergic to almost everything on a farm, and yet he never complained about
the work. He had tracked her down shortly
after the incident with Karin. Tyler had been close with Triss since her arrival
at the farm six months back. He had been the first person to sit and talk with
her after she settled at the farm. The conversation had been slightly
forced, but she had appreciated his effort despite his noticeable inability
to make casual conversation. She had let his kindness payoff for him just a few days
later. But while he had been kissing his way down her neck, she had been regretting
her decision. She had broken free of him when he made his next move
and walked back to her room alone. Triss had
taken her rejection well, and had not tested the boundaries of their friendship since.

By now, most of their farmmates had gotten seated. The landlord would be speaking
soon. Tyler turned her attention to the landlords' table. She had been told that
the landlords had owned the
property for several generation; since before the Destruction. They had always
had others living on the property. The didn't collect rent. Everyone did their
part. If anyone, including the landlords, became a problem,
there was an anonymous vote. If that
person didn't have the support of two thirds of the farm, they had to leave.
It was simple and it worked. Tyler had never known anyone who had been
forced to leave, but it had been known to happen in the past.

Jondra stood up and called the start of the meeting.

"What an unexpectedly beautiful day for a Broadcast Lunch," she said, and smiled at the
group. "I hope everyone has had positive experiences over the last week."

Jondra was the unofficial head of the landlord family. She was a beautiful, middle-aged
woman with long, dark, curly hair. She was short, with a big smile and dark
skin. Jondra treated Tyler like her daughter. In fact, Jondra treated everyone on
the farm like they were her own children.

Being their pseudo leader, Jondra was usually the speaker
at most of the farm's gatherings.
From what Tyler had heard, she had recently taken over the responsibility
from her father. Most people seemed to have been happy with the change.
The rest of Jondra's family included;
her mother, her father and his mother, her brother, and her brother's adobpted son.
Their family was not large, but they were extremely well respected amonst the 
farm community.

As Jondra summarized the week for the group, her father, 
Alvar, was reviewing the weekly population report.
The report finalized at the end of sign in, and provided
Alvar with extensive data on the changes in population over the previous week.
New arrivals would be welcomed and introduced.

Being a new arrival on the farm came along with some important
responsibilities. Upon arrival, the new potential resident could
sleep in the barn with approval from one of the landlords. During
the day, the temporary residents of the barn were given a variety
of tasks, suitable to their capabilities, although most of the time, 
they worked in the fields. They were required to eat meals with
the other residents, which was, in many ways, their most important
job. Social acceptance by the community was highly important
because at their second Broadcast Lunch, they woud be required
to pass a vote. Failure to pass this initial vote meant expulsion
from the farm. The arrival of new people to the farm was rare,
but it did happen. Tyler's own arrival, for one, but there had
also been several other additions during her six months of residency.
Today, the that roster was empty.

After dealing with the business of new arrivals, the absense of any
residents was discussed. Someone might be on this list for a
number of reasons. Most of the time, the names appearing on this
list were expected. It could be a hunting party, a trip to town,
a visit with friends, or any of a number of other reasons. In fact,
travel away from the farm was encouraged. For some, their
time at the farm simply ended, and they moved on to the next step
of their life. This was less common, but was not discouraged by
the community. Then there were the mysteries. Some would
leave in the night. Others would go to town and never return.
Accidents would happen. These mysteries were investigated,
but not overly so. In these times, things happened; life had to
move forward.
