\chapter{Broadcast Camp}
The chilled air burst into a brief gust as she neared the top of
the hill. The wind crept under the collar of her jacket, making
her unconsciously pull it tighter around her neck. Up ahead, the
data camp was already bustling with activity. It was a slow,
steady, productive type of busy. It was the type of busy brought
about by stiff limbs, a barely lit, pre-dawn sky, and recently
awoken minds.

She stopped for a moment, watching these strangers working. Most
groups were unpacking large bags of equipment. Some were working
on their screens. It was too early to setup the power arrays,
but there were enough batteries being wired up on this hilltop
to power a small camp for a week.

Most of this work was performed in silence. The majority of the
voices she was hearing could be traced to the food shed. This
was the only permanent building on the hilltop, and even this
was simple wood construction, no paint, and a roof which would
obviously be leaking in several places if not for the unusually
clear day.

Compared to the rest of the area, the food shed had attracted a
lively group. The owner was serving coffee and seemed to have
plenty of food on the grill. People were gathered, discussing
the mild events of a quiet life.

She became aware of the fact that she was avoiding entering the
camp proper. She set about deciding where to set up. After all,
nothing would postpone the broadcast. It was a busy morning, but
she did not see anyone she recognized, but this didn't really
surprise her. Almost everyone she knew had stayed at the farm.

Out of habit, she headed to her usual spot. It was off to the
side of the camp near a lone fir tree that flagged the nearby
tree line. It was a little lower than most people would set up,
but she hadn't missed a broadcast yet. As she made her way over,
she noticed a few of the usuals camped nearby. She was shy, and
they were shy; which was probably the reason she didn't know
anyone on the hill, despite the number of trips she had made.

The pack she carried was heavy, there was no other way to put
it, and she was happy to lower it off her back. She looked at
her watch, realizing she didn't have much time to waste. Her
setup ritual always started by unpacking everything. After
unzipping the pack and unfastening the waterproof seal, she
began removing the farm's equipment. At first, most of what she
removed were simply cables, bound with Velcro straps or fastened
with string. Each was labeled with tape, declaring the owner of
that specific cable. Under the cables lay the collected
electronics of the farm. Most were wrapped in cloth and bound.
Others were protected further still with foam or waterproof
bags. For now, she left them in a small pile on the ground,
still protected in their individual nests.

Next to be removed was the antenna. There was nothing special
about this device. The gray box was about as long as her forearm,
but squared and heavy. She didn't know the story behind the
farms' antenna, but it was obviously custom made. It was hardly
impressive, and the antenna her family had when she was a child
made this one seem shabby, but it managed to serve the needs of
the farm. Despite her distaste for it, she handled it carefully,
setting in gently on the grass next to the other equipment.

The pack was now empty except for one item. A large battery
pack, easily thirty pounds on its own, filled most of the bottom
area of the backpack. This she left in the pack, but unzipped it
fully to expose the numerous power connections.

It was probably selfish, but when she hiked to data camp alone,
she always connected her equipment first. She removed the worn
Tile from her jacket. It had been given to her by her mother,
who had received it, in turn, from her father. It had been
repaired many times, but seemed to handle each fix well. Her
Tile was the only one in the farm and knew the others thought
her undeserving of such a device. She removed a small cable from
her jacket and connected the Tile to the antenna.

She had instructions for connecting everything else, stored away
in the front pouch of the pack, but she felt certain she could
do it without them. She sat with the backpack in front of her,
between her outstretched legs, and started unwrapping the
smaller pieces of equipment. Many of the devices connected
directly to the battery pack, while others hooked through the
connections on other things. The web of components started
taking a somewhat familiar shape, in a way she couldn't explain
but which told her she wouldn't need to reference the
instructions.

There was now a problem. Her mind told her not to worry, but her
gut knew she was missing a cable. Karin's Hand Page still lay in
the pile of unconnected equipment, and a quick glance at the
pile of cables told her the one she needed was not included in
the set. She picked up the pace connecting the last devices.
Losing Karin's cable would be bad and would not help Tyler win
any points with her mates on the farm. As she made connections
between the last couple devices, her suspicions were confirmed.
Feeling around in the bottom of the pack turned up nothing. It's
doubtful anything fell out of the backpack, what with it being
waterproof sealed and zipped up tight. But even if the wire
turned up later, back at the farm, Karin will have missed her
broadcast, and Tyler will be blamed.

Frustrated with herself, she made a helpless glance around the
area in which she was seated. To no surprise, nothing was lying
unconnected around her. Well, the antenna was still not
connected. She smiled as she hooked up the most important
component, as she thought about how much worse the situation
would have been, had she forgotten to hook up the antenna as she
hunted for one cable. And anyway, Karin and her were on good
terms. Certainly, she could make it seven days without a
broadcast. But still, this was a sloppy move.

As she sat with her thoughts, the sun rose behind her. She
noticed the ambient change and glanced back at the sliver of
yellow in the distance. Two weeks ago when she was here, the sun
hadn't come up until the broadcast had started. Her watch told
her she had another three minutes today.

Sometimes the broadcasts were late. Less often, they were early.
One of her first weeks on the farm, an early broadcast was
responsible for a ninety percent data loss. Joseph was blamed
for the loss, and had few friends for the following six days.
The next broadcast confirmed his story, but even with his name
cleared, he had yet to travel back to the data camp for
broadcast.

The beeps from the devices in front of her signaled that
today's broadcast was more or less on time. The indicator on the
battery pack showed as full. Even Karin's Hand Page turned on,
reminding Tyler of her screw up. She reached over and shut it
off. There was no sense running down the battery, as well. A
quick look over the other equipment verified that everything was
ready for the broadcast.

\chapter{Two}
Tyler rounded the bend that signified she was three miles from
the farm. The broadcast had felt like a wash. On one hand, it
had been smooth: her draw had been high, the manifest had
completed with no errors, and power draw had been rather low. On
the other hand, she was thinking the whole way home about how to
apologize to Karin.

The last three miles was always the longest. On foot, a trip to
data camp took four and a half hours. With a good broadcast draw
you could do the whole thing in five. Many of the other
travelers to data camp came on horseback. Some even drove. On
Tyler's farm, though, the horses were usually put to work. They
didn't have any motorized vehicles, at least, of which she was
aware. They had always walked. She had volunteered for the trips
soon after her arrival at the farm, and after a few months of
shadowing the process, they gave her the responsibility of
making the trip solo.

Despite the season, it had warmed up quickly. She had removed
her jacket before leaving data camp. The skin of her arms and
face was still chilled, but she could tell her shirt was damp
with sweat under the straps of the backpack.

She passed by the farms' nearest neighbor, an old recluse who
went by Peters. His home barely qualified as a shack, but the
old metal roof seemed to miraculously support an impressive
power array. The panels, covered in dust, must have been
working, considering the volume of the music being played in the
house. His windows were curtained with various cloth materials
but Tyler always felt like she was being watched when she was
passing the house.

Another half hour and she was passing through the open gate and
walking up the road to the farmhouse.

The main house was an ancient house, with six official bedrooms,
but it currently slept around thirty people. Additionally,
scattered around the rest of the property were a handful of
other buildings which housed an additional forty or so.

Tyler made her way up to the house. Several of her mates waved
at her as they milled around tending to the business of the
farm, but there was no grand celebration for her safe return.

On broadcast day, all the members of the farm ate lunch
together. Even if you had nothing on the manifest, you were
required to sign in. The landlords would assist in settling
disputes. Issues pertaining to the farm were discussed. Weekly
assignments were given out. At the end of this event, the
devices could be collected.

Since the trip had gone smoothly, there was still time before
the meal was prepared. Tyler had decided to apologize to Karin
before lunch. Inside the house, she made her way downstairs to
the basement. Bryce was in the basement, with several lights on
around him. He was inspecting some data using a page on the
wall. Bryce maintained the data on the farm, and it kept him
very busy. In addition to caring for the equipment, he assisted
with special tasks and device repairs. He was certainly no
wizard with tools, but he cared about details and always took
his time. Also, he was the best person for the job right now.

"You forgot Karin's cable, today," he said as she entered. His
eyes remained focused on his work.

"Yeah...," was the best she could come up with as she crossed
the room and unloaded her pack onto a bench next to the far
wall. The missing cable sat in the center of the nearby table.
"Do you know where she is?"

"Haven't seen her. But she's probably out back. I think she has
the plane working." Bryce gave her a sly smile. Tyler raised an
eyebrow in return. The plane was working? That would be worth
seeing, even if it came along with delivery of some bad news.

\chapter{Three}
It turned out that the plane was not working. You could say the
plane was RUNNING... sort of. You could say the plane was
MOVING. You could NOT, however, say the plane was working. But
still, there it sat in the yard, propeller spinning away with a
quiet hum. A small group of the farms inhabitants were looking
at the plane awkwardly. They were looking at the plane awkwardly
to avoid looking at Karin, who was looking at Tyler.

"So, what you're saying," Karin said patronizingly, "is that traveling to Broadcast isn't
something you're able to take care of on your own?" She continued, obviously
not expecting an answer, "I understand it's a lot of stress. We can find
someone else who wants to take it seriously."

Karin was a little
angrier than Tyler had expected. Their present situation had
been building in the two minutes since Tyler had given her
the bad news. She would have appreciated someone coming 
to her defense, but that wasn't likely. Everyone knew the frustration
of missing Broadcast, including Tyler.

"Look, Karin, I'm sorry. I can't fix this. I can only tell you I'm sorry.
You can be mad at me if you want."

The plea had no affect.

"You don't get it!" Karin finally shouted. "The plan for the last piece of the plane was on my
manifest. What the hell am I supposed to do for the next week? I have
nothing to work on! They never should have let you go alone."

With this final exasperated observation, the young woman turned in
her boots. One quick gesture on her control board silenced the motor
powering the planes' rotor. The small crowd nearby made a performance
of avoiding the enraged girl by nearly scattering as she approached.
Karin lifted the plane despite its seven foot wingspan and headed to
the workshop next to the barn.


\chapter{Four}
By lunchtime, the tension lifted somewhat. The surprisingly beautiful
weather meant that this weeks' Broadcast lunch was held outdoors.
Long wooden tables, set just off the farmhouses' back porch, served
these events well. Off to one side of the eating area, the landlords 
sat at their own, smaller table. The community
sign-in book was open on their table, and the landlords greeted, and
made smalltalk with, the members of the farm as they approached the
table to sign in. Although Broadcast Lunch was taken seriously, there
seemed to be an unspoken agreement amongst the farmers to keep
the mood light.

Tyler was sitting with her friend, Triss. Primarily a field hand, his appearance
hardly fit the job description. He was tall, with miniature, wiry, muscles.
His face was long, narrow, and with high cheekbones. His hair was jet black,
thick, and long enough to cover most of his ears and neck. The poor guy was
allergic to almost everything on a farm, and yet he never complained about
the work. He had tracked her down shortly
after the incident with Karin. Tyler had been close with Triss since her arrival
at the farm six months back. He had been the first person to sit and talk with
her after she settled at the farm. The conversation had been slightly
forced, but she had appreciated his effort despite his noticeable inability
to make casual conversation. She had let his kindness payoff for him just a few days
later. But while he had been kissing his way down her neck, she had been regretting
her decision. She had broken free of him when he made his next move
and walked back to her room alone. Triss had
taken her rejection well, and had not tested the boundaries of their friendship since.

By now, most of their farmmates had gotten seated. The landlord would be speaking
soon. Tyler turned her attention to the landlords' table. She had been told that
the landlords had owned the
property for several generation; since before the Destruction. They had always
had others living on the property. The didn't collect rent. Everyone did their
part. If anyone, including the landlords, became a problem,
there was an anonymous vote. If that
person didn't have the support of two thirds of the farm, they had to leave.
It was simple and it worked. Tyler had never known anyone who had been
forced to leave, but it had been known to happen in the past.

Jondra stood up and called the start of the meeting.

"What an unexpectedly beautiful day for a Broadcast Lunch," she said, and smiled at the
group. "I hope everyone has had positive experiences over the last week."

Jondra was the unofficial head of the landlord family. She was a beautiful, middle-aged
woman with long, dark, curly hair. She was short, with a big smile and dark
skin. Jondra treated Tyler like her daughter. In fact, Jondra treated everyone on
the farm like they were her own children.

Being their pseudo leader, Jondra was usually the speaker
at most of the farm's gatherings.
From what Tyler had heard, she had recently taken over the responsibility
from her father. Most people seemed to have been happy with the change.
The rest of Jondra's family included;
her mother, her father and his mother, her brother, and her brother's adobpted son.
Their family was not large, but they were extremely well respected amonst the 
farm community.

As Jondra summarized the week for the group, her father, 
Alvar, was reviewing the weekly population report.
The report finalized at the end of sign in, and provided
Alvar with extensive data on the changes in population over the previous week.
New arrivals would be welcomed and introduced.

Being a new arrival on the farm came along with some important
responsibilities. Upon arrival, the new potential resident could
sleep in the barn with approval from one of the landlords. During
the day, the temporary residents of the barn were given a variety
of tasks, suitable to their capabilities, although most of the time, 
they worked in the fields. They were required to eat meals with
the other residents, which was, in many ways, their most important
job. Social acceptance by the community was highly important
because at their second Broadcast Lunch, they woud be required
to pass a vote. Failure to pass this initial vote meant expulsion
from the farm. The arrival of new people to the farm was rare,
but it did happen. Tyler's own arrival, for one, but there had
also been several other additions during her six months of residency.
Today, the that roster was empty.

After dealing with the business of new arrivals, the absense of any
residents was discussed. Someone might be on this list for a
number of reasons. Most of the time, the names appearing on this
list were expected. It could be a hunting party, a trip to town,
a visit with friends, or any of a number of other reasons. In fact,
travel away from the farm was encouraged. For some, their
time at the farm simply ended, and they moved on to the next step
of their life. This was less common, but was not discouraged by
the community. Then there were the mysteries. Some would
leave in the night. Others would go to town and never return.
Accidents would happen. These mysteries were investigated,
but not overly so. In these times, things happened; life had to
move forward. As with the new arrival list, this list was reported
to be empty.

With the formalities disposed, there was a noticable increase in
peoples attention toward Jondra. It was time for Collection to begin.

Collection was used to encourage attendance of the lunch.
Bryce hosted this portion of the event and he had been busy
syncronizing devices with the farms cental system and verifying
the Broadcast manifests since Tyler and dropped off the backpack.
To improve the farm's data pool, all
personal devices were required to be syncronized. The community
put up with the personal data tracking, as it increased
community accountability and greatly increased the farms
mining capabilities.

Today was a little odd due to the fact that Bryce had not arrived
at lunch yet. Data syncronization was a relatively
quick process, and Bryce was very practiced at the task. But,
there were many things that could go wrong or slow the
process, and so his absense was not extrordinary.

"As Bryce has not yet arrived,"
Jondra said to the group, "go ahead and enjoy your meals.
We will resume the meeting in a little bit."

The farm enforced Page Silence on the morning of
Broadcast. This wasn't very difficult to enforce, since most devices
were in the pack on the way to Broadcast Camp. However, for
people who had not requested Broadcast, the rule was monitored,
and whoever travelled to Broadcast Camp was also expected
to comply. Everyone considered it a terribly old-fashioned policy
and it was probably the most violated policy on the farm.

To combat the lack of device usage, the farm encouraged a variety
of activities for those not already assigned morning work.
Demonstrations, such as the plane Karin had been constructing,
were also encouraged. Even with the distractions, everyone
was very focused on getting their devices back after Broadcast.

Tyler had resisted the natural impulse, and caught herself
several times pulling out her Page. Had she not resisted,
the central system at the farm woud have quickly noticed
and logged it into her file, which could jeopordize her
ability to make future trips, especially when compounded
with the incident with Karin.

It was not long before Bryce arrived at the table with the
devices. He seemed very focused today, for someone
who was generally very laid back. 

"If I could get everyone's attention for just a couple
minutes," he started. "I have an important announcement
concerning all of us. Then I will distribute devices."

The announcement would be a message from the city. These
messages arrived from time to time, and related to Union-wide
matters. The impact of the announcements
ranged in scale from renaming of far off cities (with which Bryce
would not even bother them) to impending attacks from
other counrties (which, these days, were very rare).

"There is not a great way to start this," Bryce spoke slowly,
"But, basically, it seems they are cutting Broadcast down to
every two weeks." He paused as the audience went from 
silent to distinct murmuring. Bryce went on, "The resons for
this change are not given. I know this is a shock to everyone."

A change like this was big. Broadcast had been established
a long time ago, shortly after the end of the Destruction.
A Broadcast would be missed every now and then. In times
of Union unease, the Broadcast could stop for several weeks.
But, to make a sweeping change in the Broadcast without
reason was a shock.

Bryce wrapped up, "Next weeks Broadcast is scheduled,
but there will not be one the following week, so please
plan ahead. Also, since the Broadcast will be handling
much larger manifests, I would expect higher data loss
rates. We'll have to see how it goes." He started laying
out the devices on the table. "That's all I have for today."

The end of Bryce's talk started the usual commotion, as
everyone milled up to the table to retrieve their device.
The concern everyone felt over Broadcast was quickly
masked by the prospect of their new data. Messages
from family and friends, news from the city, applications,
database updates, packages, and other updates all
awaited them in the Page world. Little would be said
the rest of the lunch as everyone synced themselves.

Tyler was in a rush, too, but was still avoiding Karin.
As Karen arrived at the table, she snatched her
un-synced device quickly and shot Tyler a look of 
cold anger. Karin's anger toward Tyler could be thought
of as a preview of the way the entire farm would feel
in two weeks; after the first of many missed broadcasts.

\chapter{Five}
Bryce took each device out of the backpack and laid it on
his workbench. Despite her screwup today, Tyler always did
a good job traveling to Broadcast Camp, despite growing up
outside of broadcast distance. She had a natural ability
with electronics.

When Tyler had arrived at the farm, there was much
discussion over the situation. Presumably, she had no
family. She claimed her parents had both died in an
accident. She had traveled to the farm after finding it
marked on one of her father's maps. The distance she
had walked was great, and she had had little in the
way of supplies when she arrived, but she was in good
health. She was apparently a strong survivor. However,
it was interesting that, although her father had
apparently known about the farm, no one on the 
farm seemed to know anything about Tyler or her
parents.

And then there was the mystery with her Hand Page.
Bryce removed it from the backpack and set 
it on the workbench. It immediately turned on and
began the syncing process. Bryce watched the progess
on the Page propped up next to him.

Tyler's Hand Page was unique. It was obviously military
quality, but most devices these days were. Very few of
the consumer products were still working, although
there were some.
During his repairs of the device, he noticed technology
which he had never seen, and knew nothing about.
He worried what he would do if one of these parts
ever wore out. And so, he had always done his best
work on the repairs the special device needed.

But still, hers seemed to have
limitless capacity - not that Tyler was using much of it.
Her manifests consisted mostly of books, which she
seemed to have an amazing ability to locate. In the
short time she had lived on the farm, she had increased
the library of books by probably fifty percent.

The sync completed, with the security scan, as Bryce
suspected, showing nothing unusual. It reported the
unusually long web paths and a large number of 
unique retrievals, but this was completely expected
and not unusual for Tyler. In general, her manifest was
valuable for the farm and very clean. The girl was
a good retriever.

Her device powered off when it completed and he placed
the next one on the table. Most of these would not
go as smoothly as Tylers, due to: longer manifests,
slower electronics, and additional security checks.
The one currently on the table was a specific
troublemaker, so he turned his attention to the
Union update.

The Union included a rather large manifest with
each broadcast. Failure to accept the manifest blocked
the entire Broadcast, making it madatory. The
majority of it was useless, and was simply archived 
for later use. Bryce started reviewing the week's
manifest. There was special bulletin which he began
reading.

\chapter{Tyler}
Morgan made her way down the trail she had walked many
times. She was nearing the end and could see the fire
flickering in the distance.

This was the first time this year they had done this.
For years, she and Triss had met out here to play
games, gossip, plan trips, and dream. Late in the fall,
Tyler began joining them, which had originally angered
Morgan greatly, but was now just mildly frustrating.
She liked Tyler, but this time with Triss was important;
he was someone who she had been friends with her entire
life. Coming out to this spot was their tradition
and she didn't like sharing it with someone new
just because Triss had suddenly turned into a love sick
puppy. Strangely, though, Tyler and Triss seemed
to just be friends. And, she had to admit that
Tyler was fun. She brought a wit to the evenings; something of
which Triss was less capable. Tyler was
smart and, yet, seemed to genuinely care about,
Triss, which Morgan appreciated.

As she reached the edge of the light eminating from
the fire, she saw Tyler and Triss sitting, side by side,
in front of it. Both had their Pages out, and were
playing some kind of gesture imitation game. They
both moved their hands in decent syncronization.
Occasionally, one of them would make a mistake
and Triss would erupt with laughter. Tyler would
smile and look sweetly back at him, only
joining in the laughter once in a while.

Everytime Morgan saw Tyler she was reminded how
jealous she was of her hair. That girl had such light
hair. No one on the farm had hair as light as hers.
It was the color of straw and fell halfway down her
back.

"What took you so long?" asked Tyler as Morgan
entered the circle of light from the fire.

"Oh," Morgan sighed, "Gily isn't keeping time
with the other guys and wanted me to skip
tonight. He's mad now because I told him I
wouldn't."

Gily was Morgan's boyfriend of almost three years;
basically the entire time he had lived there.
Morgan had lived on the farm her whole life.
Gily was a burley man, with plenty of extra muscle.
He had arrived with a passing timber company,
and had decided to stay after Morgan had
taken him to her bed... three nights in a row.
Looking back, she
didn't view it as the wisest decision, but she didn't
often regret it. Gily could be a pain and would
sometimes get blindly drunk, but he seemed to
have a soft spot for Morgan, and took good care
of her. On the other hand, he wanted nothing to do
with her friends, Tyler and Triss. Tyler, specifically,
clashed harshly with him, and the two avoided
each other whenever possible.

Changing the subject, she posed the question,
"What do you guys think about the Broadcast
change?"

"Well," answered Triss, "based on what I saw
today, I think Karin is going to be pretty upset."
He giggled and looked to Tyler for approval.
She smiled and gave him a nod. She had made
the same comment to him only moments
ago.

"It seems stange to me," said Morgan, and
then felt very silly for saying it.
Obviously, it was strange. When the broadcast
had originally been scheduled weekly, it was
because of the energy crisis. But certainly,
the crisis couldn't be any worse now than it
had been. Most of the waring had stopped
over fifteen years ago. Shouldn't things be
improving? But, she realized that none 
of these thoughts needed
to be brought up, they were all thinking it.

Tyler looked out into the valley. Quietly,
she said, "It's certainly difficult to figure out what's
going on out there." In many ways, this was as
pointless a comment as Morgan's, but it was
spoken with certain amount of intrigue which
cause both Triss and Morgan to focus on
the words intently. The three of them sat quietly,
listening to the pops of the fire as they stared
into the night.

\chapter{Wood Party}
A couple hours had past and the fire had been
allowed to die down. The were maintaining the
hot coals one log at a time as they sat
together on the bare ground at its front.

The night seemed never ending.
There was gossip of Triss and his "girlfriend" in the big
city, who continued asking him to take her out,
despite being only fifteen and having no idea he
was nine years older. The girls called him a creep,
but laughed it off. He was harmless, anyway,
and would never leave the farm.
Morgan was planning a long trip north to look
for Gily's family. They were leaving in the late
spring. It meant crossing into the next country
illegally and she had little information on the area,
but she was excited none the less. Tyler had a new
book of ghost stories from before the Destruction.
It was fiction, of course, but the world it described
fed their imagination wildly as they sat around the
fire reading.

Eventually, the conversation wound down. Tyler and
Triss sat on the ground, their backs resting against
the big log which had been their chair just a short
while ago. Morgan lay stretched out between them,
her head resting on Tyler's thigh and her legs draped
over Triss's legs. Tyler was hard at work braiding an
elaborate webbing through Morgan's hair using bits of
green wood she had cut from a tree.

As the sat silently (with Triss slowly nodding his head
up and down as he fought sleep), the sound of a owl
began repeating quietly, and then quickly a little
louder. In less than a second, crickets joined in, along
with a quiet wolf howl. The camp was suddenly alive
with the artificial sounds of wilderness. Tyler's Page,
which was still out was laying beside her. When she
glanced over, the owls went silent and a map appeared.

"That's interesting," Tyler said. Morgan sat up, allowing
Tyler to stand with the Page in her hand. She walked
around the fire holding it in front of her. She was now
facing the valley. The others had their Pages out now,
too.

"Can you see them?" asked Morgan.

"No. Not yet. Wait. Maybe." She moved to her right
just a little. "Yes," she affirmed. "Someone is down
there."

The other two stood now beside her and the small group
looked into the valley. Still a good ways away, could be
seen the distinct movement of light through the trees.

\chapter{Visitors}
It wasn't unheard of to see people in the woods at
night. In fact, the only reason the security system
bothered to notify the three of them was because
they were nearby. That being said, Tyler didn't want
an encounter with this group, and it seemed to be
climbing the hill directly towards them.

"They've no doubt seen the fire," stated Morgan,
matter-of-factly. "Should we just head back?" The
trio's campsite was not technically on the farm
property; it was quite a ways off it, actually. But
the land wasn't claimed by anyone else, and the
farm was the nearest settlement.

"It's up to you guys," Tyler decided. "I think I'm
going to wait around and get a look at these 
darks. Shouldn't be too hard to hide out."

"I'm for," said Triss. Morgan felt their eyes on her
and the social pressue won.

"Alright. But let's find a good spot. And far back."

They left the fire and headed off into the darkness.
It was immensely dark. Tyler turned up the
brightness on her page until they had 
enough light to walk.
They move slowly through the underbrush,
as torns and sticks scratched at them.
Tyler had purposefully picked this route as it
wouldn't likely be the route the mystery
party would take.

She led them around the back and then up
a small rise. The small hill put them almost
level with the height of their original location,
but they were now separated from the camp
by around fifty meters of dense undergrowth.
Laying flat on the back side of the knoll, they
would be basically invisible.

They expected to see people any moment,
but it was a long fifteen minutes before lights
and voices began drifting towards them from
beyond the fire. As they had expected, the
travelers had headed towards their campfire.
The first person who walked into the light
surprised all of them. It was a Union Police
Officer.

\chapter{Union Police}
Bishop Dale liked being out in the forest. He
was rarely able to travel away from his urban
neighborhood. He enjoyed taking his children
to the park, and they had even camped in the
park once. Right now, it was dark; really dark.
But he was enjoying the sounds of the forest
and trying not to think too much about the
mission.

"Sir," one of his men reported, 
"we've spotted a fire at the top of the hill."

"Thank you. Bear that direction," Bishop
ordered. "We'll
investigate it." The subordinate turned and
made his way to the front of the party. Soon,
Bishop and the rest of the team was on
the move again.

Bishop hoped this wasn't a settlement
somehow left off the map. His teams presence
here wasn't meant to be secret, but they
weren't trying to trespass, either. Marching
into a settlement in the middle of night was
bad publicity, at best, or deadly, if the
settlement was hostile.

As they neared the hill, and the campfire,
Bishop ordered the team to holster their
weapons. Only a few of the team even had
theirs drawn. He saw no one around, but
the fire was freshly built up. No doubt, the
campers saw his team approaching. They
either left or hid.

"Hello!" Bishop addressed the dark forest,
"My name is Bishop Dale, Rank 3 officer of
the Union Police. Please return to camp and
introduce yourself. We are no threat to you."
He waited patiently for a reply and then
looked back at his team for Gretta. Seeing
her, he said, "Gretta, can you do a scan?"

"Yes, sir," she responded, "Doing it now."

It was a crude tool, the scanner, but it
rarely gave false information, just incomplete
information. As the results appeared on the
screen, he began speaking again.

"Trissan Potts and Morgan Alvarez. I assume
you can hear me. Please remember what I
say and pass it on to your leaders." Bishop
spoke slowly, considering his words carefully.

"Tomorrow, we will stop by to meet with
your community. We may need their help
with our investigation. We request everyones
coorporation." Bishop Dale stood a moment,
considered saying more, and then decided
against it.

He turned around and spoke to the others,
"Alright team, head east along this ridge,
same as before. Keep your eyes open."

The scout of the group considered his
options and then ducked under the low
hanging branch of a large tree and headed
off into the woods. The others followed,
the lights on their uniforms casting that
same eerie glow on the forest around them.
Bishop brought up the rear. Just before he
stepped under the branch he scanned the
dark one more time, but saw no one.

\chapter{The Message}
Tyler watched with her two friends as the
UPs headed east, away from the camp. There
was nothing scary about the encounter; nothing
suspicious; no reason to be hiding in the woods.
Still, when the call had come for them to come
out, she put a hand on each of her friends,
communicating her intention to stay 
where they were.

After they emerged from hiding and returned
to the fire circle, the tone was somber.

"What was that all about?" wonder Morgan aloud.

Triss had a more specific question, 
"Why are the police in the woods?" It was a good
question.

Tyler thought of a question they actually needed
to answer. "Do you think we should tell Jondra
tonight?"

It was already late. Most of the community would
be asleep. Waking Jondra would surely alarm many
others. Perhaps it would be best to wait for morning.
It wasn't like the Union Policy were planning an
attack or anything.

"I think we should. Shouldn't we?" said a rather
worried looking Morgan.

"We should," agreed Triss.

"Why don't you tell her, then," joked Tyler.

Triss made a startled face and said, 
"I don't want to tell her. You're the one she likes."

Triss wasn't being serious, but he was right. Jondra
did like Tyler and Jondra should probably be told tonight.
Tyler placed Jondra into the Page queue and
put the Page away until the connection was made.

They walked in silence a while before the Page
alerted Tyler that Jondra was on. Tyler removed
the Page from its pocket. Jondra looked quite
awake for having been obviously just woken.

"Hi, Tyler," Jondra said softly.

Tyler tried to be concise, "Hi, Jondra. We were in
the forest southeast of the farm about two
kilometers and saw Union Police."

Jondra looked more awake now. "Is everything
alright? What happened?"

Tyler again spoke concisely, "Nothing happened.
We hid, but they knew we were there.
Left a message saying
they were coming by the farm tomorrow to talk.
Then they headed east."

Jondra was quiet. Then she said with a smile,
"Well, it's probably nothing. Thanks for
reporting. Please get back safely."

"We will, we're almost back now."

"Alright. Goodnight, Tyler."

"Goodnight."

The conversation ended and the forest was 
silent again.

Morgan broke the silence. "Hey, why did that
dark only know me and Triss were there?"

"His tech must not pick up my Page,"
Tyler said. "Must only read certain kinds
of hardware."

\chapter{Barracks}
When they reached the fenceline of the farm
Morgan left the group, taking the shorter
path towards the farm house where she
stayed. Tyler and Triss threw up casual
hand waves signifying her departure and began
following the fence in the other direction, towards
the barracks.

Aside the farmhouse, people generally lived
in the barracks. The barracks consisted of three
buildings on one edge of the farm. Those who
did not stay in one of these two places did so
out of choice, and had typically created their
own camps around the farm someplace. Some
people preferred privacy. As for the barracks,
they we roughly divided into three groups:
people with children, long term residents, and
new residents.

The barracks did not provide much in the way
of privacy. Each person had their own small
room, but most of the living space was shared.
When the barracks was powered, it provided
running water and, occasionally, hot water.

Triss lived in the long term barracks, having lived
on the farm his entire life. Tyler and Triss entered
the side door of the long building. It was warmer
inside, but not much. Heating was too inefficient.
Lighting, on the other hand, could be supplied
all night, and a variety of lighting strips gave
the room plenty of light to move about in the room.

Quietly, the pair walked across the open living
area and entered the corridor of the 
northern wing of rooms. Just two doors down,
they reached Triss's room. Tyler gave him a hug
and told him to have a good night. He closed the
door behind him and Tyler continued down the
hallway.

Just three doors down, she paused at another
door, but moments later, turn back, returned to
living area, crossed to the door, and exited.

Back outside, she headed across the circular
courtyard between the three barrack buldings.
She entered one of the others, the new resident
barracks, and made her way to her own room.

She entered her room and sat on the bed. The,
room was mostly empty, common for someone
new to the farm. Most of the decoration were
clothing; a small pile decorated on corner, and
some folded stack decorated a bench against one
wall. From the wall she had hung a variety of item
she had found or collected since arriving. An
unframed canvas painted with a dolpin jumping
over the planet Jupiter hung in the middle of one
wall. The other wall displayed her small collection of
antlers. She had one shelf of item from
pre-Destruction, mostly just stuff that seemed
interesting, but probably had no real value.

She removed her Page from her jacket and
connected it to a cable running from the wall.
It was charging right now, but the barracks would
probably go dead before morning. It was rare to
make it though a whole night with power.

She removed her jacket and hung it on a
hook next to
another, substantially thicker jacket. She slid
her pants off and tossed them in the pile with
the other clothes. From the same pile she dug
out another pair of pants, but these meant for
sleeping. She slipped them on and left her room;
headed for the bathroom.  

\chapter{Morgan}
Although, she and Gily lived in the basement,
in an unfinished room, she appreciated the
conveniences that came from living in the
farmhouse. There was power available on all but the
darkest days of winter, and running water was
accessible from a sink, built into a private
area next to their room.

She stood at this sink, looking at herself in the mirror,
which hung over it. The lighting was poor, but
she wouldn't turn it brighter as it would leak over the
top of the unfinished wall to where Gily was sleeping.
She still felt young, but her body was surely aging.
The creases of her body were turning into permanent
wrinkles. They were soft and she didn't mind them, but
they were slowly taking her youth. She was turning thirty
one next month. Gily was seven years
older than Morgan. His body had
hardly aged in the time she had known him.
She still found herself taking
notice when he walked into a room. He took care of her
and she knew he loved her. She loved him more than
anyone.

Gily had told her about Grace six weeks ago. The
argument had drug out for hours. Morgan helt as
though she had run out of tears. The way he had
made it all her fault was eating away at her. He
had said he could never be faithful with just her.
It stung, and she had grown determined to prove him
wrong. The following weeks had been better. She had
given it her all to keep him at home. It had seemed to be
working until the previous night, when he left after
dinner without saying a word. She was crushed.

Today they had fought until she had left with Tyler
and Triss. They knew none of this. Now, Morgan was
scared again that Gily would leave. Standing there
at the sink, she looked again at the girl in the mirror.
That girl had tears, now, running down her face, but
Morgan thought there was determination in her eyes.
As she removed her clothes, the unexercised, but
not unattractive body, 
which had once been used to convince
Gily to leave the timber company, began to reveal
itself. What she saw in the mirror
was long, dark, hair hanging over a round
face; thin arms, a soft belly, and wide hips;
standing on normal legs.
Fully naked, now, standing at the mirror, she carefully
wiped the remaining tears off her face. She turned and
quietly opened the door to the room where she would
attempt to give Gily at least one good reason to stay.

\chapter{Lack of Answers}
Jondra's meeting with the Union Police had been of little
use to the curiosity of anyone on the farm.
Bishop Dale informed her that his team,
and probably others, would be in the area performing
an investigation. He would appreciate the farms
cooperation with the investigation by simply staying
out of the way. He told her he expected the investigation
to wrap up quickly. He had not answered questions
and he had left before five minutes had past.
It was a small performance considering the
lavish promotion last night in the woods.

None of this followed any reasonable logic, and Jondra
hadn't been fooled. The UPs were investigating
something, that much was true. But this was not
routine, in any sense. There was more beneath the
surface of this investigation, but Jondra would not
learn any more just yet.

Despite her unease, her parents lounged quietly,
as they sat together on the office's plush couch.

"Really, pumpkin," her mother spoke to her sweetly.
"I don't think there is anything to worry about."

Her father agreed. "Yes, honey, there was a time
when police patrolled this area regularly."
He continued, "It's probably not a bad idea
to have them around once in a while." Jondra
decided to keep silent. There was no point
starting an argument with her parents.

"I suppose I can live with that assessment," she
said in a tone meant to settle them, "You two
are always keeping me grounded." She smiled
at them, adoring the way her father still
put his arm around her mother when they sat
together. "Well, I have some things to care for."

She left them the room and each others company
and walked across the second floor of the
farmhouse to her own room. In her memories,
it was still her parent's room, but it had become
hers when she was passed the responsibilities of the
farm. The room was large with an attached
bathroom, as well as a sliding door leading
directly to the porch. The carpet had long ago
worn out, and they had pulled it out, but the
floors gave the room a natural look she liked.

The bed in the center of the room was huge.
Her parents told her it was what used to be
called a "California King". The original mattress
had been replaced long ago with a handmade
one stuffed with feathers. She had grown up
in this room, having shared it with her parents
as a child and then having it to herself these
last few years. This room could be in any other
place in the world and she would feel like she
was home.

She lay back on the bed and glanced at the 
panel on the wall beyond her outstretched feet.
It light up with the power map of the farm.
The lower right quarter of the panel no longer
displayed, but Bryce had coerced the software
into ignoring that space and so the panel
was still limping along.

Looking at the power map confirmed another
strong day for generation. The farm's panels
were providing forty percent over current
usage, and the energy storage system would
be nearly full by sunset.

Out of habit, Jondra reached up to flip the
panel to her next application before
remembering the gesture capture system
had given out last week. With a groan, she
rose to a seated position again and sat
a moment, building the will to actually
stand. Finally standing, she walked the
six or so feet to the panel and brushed
her search application onto the panel. It
would be worth looking a little into the
UP visit. Data could be found, if you knew
how to look. She set about mining the
farm's servers.

\chapter{The Cave}
Bishop and his team entered the cave two
hours after seeing the man enter it. Until
he ordered them in, they had been
standing around outside. Now, he could
happily report, if asked to do so, that they
were standing around inside.

The cave system had extended further
into the mountain than expected, however,
the small part of Bishop that had hoped
to find a super villan lair was left
unsatisfied as they reached the rocky end
of the road and discovered only more
darkness.

Now, standing on the uneven ground,
one of the younger
soldiers suggested it was an elaborate trap,
causing mild panic amongst the team.

"Alright," Bishop conceded, "Head back,
double time. But be safe. Watch your
footing. Let's get out of this damn cave."

He was frustrated leaving. He would have
prefered investigating more thoroughly.
But the kid had been right, a trap like that,
however unlikely, could have been executed
by that man. No sense taking chances.
They would catch up with him eventually.
It was only a matter of time.

But how did
he get out of that cave? Bishop had
seen his scout's live feed as he had eyes
on the dark walking into that place.
Finding him not there only made Bishop
more sure they were on the right track.

His team set up camp at the mouth of
the cave.

\chapter{Day Off}
Having traveled to Broadcast Camp yesterday,
Tyler had today to herself. Days off were not
customarilly observed on the farm, and it was
generally expected one would help out in some
way or learn something new. Enforcement wasn't
necessary, it seemed to happen naturally.

It was on these days that Tyler often found
herself in the kitchen, working with Vishnu.
An old man, with greying hair and wrinkled skin,
Vishnu was one of the few residents who had
moved to the farm from the city. He was also
one of the few residents who remembered the
time before the Destruction.

Tyler thought Vishnu an absolute wizard in the
kitchen. His creativity turned the farm's 
canned fruit and pickled vegetables into fragrant
meals which routinely turned heads of the people
walking past the kitched. And in the summer,
with plenty of fresh produce, the food could
take on mystical qualities. In fact, a good deal
of the farm lore bore mention of Vishnu's famous
creations.

Today, Tyler was sitting in front of a giant stock pot
making something inbetween stew and gravy.
Vishnu would hobble up to Tyler with arms full,
the contents of which would be left for her
to clean, dice, and incorporate into the pot.
He would mutter to himself and continue to
explore the pantry, waiting for one of its occupants
to slide into place in one of his mental recipes.
